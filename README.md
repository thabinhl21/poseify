## Inspiration
Asynchronous online education, especially in the context of motion-related activities, can be a hassle. We often need to make multiple video attempts until we generate one that we feel comfortable sharing. Some reasons that may make this process burdensome and dissuade individuals from creating content:

1. messy background,
2. self-conscious about personal appearance
3. poor camera technology
4. time consuming to edit video
5. confusion over right-left sides in video

We wanted to automate the task of sending videos and make it a fun and easy experience for the senders. Therefore, we made Poseify, a one-stop solution for converting your video to simplified animations, easy for students to follow along. The simple animation steps along with color-coded right and left sides is ideal for generating: 1) Yoga sequences 2) Martial arts drills 3) Physical therapy exercises 4) Dance steps 5) Fitness Class

## What it does
- Asks the user to record or upload a video
- The ML model converts the video to a series of simplified drawings of stick figures
- The user can easily select frames they want to keep
- Final GIF sequences are available for user download or upload through the web application
- Users are sent a text message through Twilio, welcoming them to Poseify once they join
